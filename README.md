# InvestmentCalculator

Hello!!

This is just a little app that i made when i was looking at ISA investments it just takes in some info about the ISA and will output how much money should be in the isa after
each year, ye not really that impressive + I also uploaded the whole virtual enviroment aswell by accident 

Anyway the application is just a single file exe in the dist folder that can be downloaded as just that file and used strait off the bat.
